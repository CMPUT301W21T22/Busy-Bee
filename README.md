# Spearmint

Spearmint is an interactive app for experimenters and owners to interrelate with experiments. The focus of this app surrounds on experiments, specifically 4 kinds of crowd-sourced tests: counts (e.g. how many of something was seen?), binomial trials (e.g. pass or fail), non-negative integer counts (e.g. each trial has 0 or more of something), measurement trials (e.g. temperature). yes
